✅ Later To-Do Checklist for Authentication System

This file lists the things to improve or add to the current authentication system later in development or before production deployment.

🔐 Security Enhancements

Token Versioning to invalidate old refresh tokens on password change or logout.

Rate Limiting using express-rate-limit to prevent brute force or abuse.

Add Helmet middleware for securing HTTP headers.

CORS refinement to restrict trusted domains only.

CSRF protection for form-based requests.

Store cookies with httpOnly, secure, and sameSite=strict in production.

🔐 Forgot Password Flow

Implement forgotPasswordRequest to send a secure reset token.

Implement resetForgottenPassword to allow users to reset password with valid token.

Add expiry to reset token (15–30 mins recommended).

Hash reset token in the database for security.

Invalidate reset token after use.

🧪 Validation & Testing

Add request body validation using Zod or Joi.

Unit tests for utility functions (e.g., password hashing, token creation).

Integration tests for auth endpoints (login, signup, verify).

Manual & automated testing for edge cases.

🧱 Infrastructure & Monitoring

Logging with winston or pino for request tracking and error logs.

Set up a proper .env.production file for secure deployments.

Set alerts for failed logins or high-volume token refreshes.

Use tools like Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking.

🔍 Audit & Admin Features (Optional)

Create audit logs for actions like login, logout, password changes.

Add RBAC (done ✅) — refine for multiple roles/scopes later.

Add admin panel to monitor users/sessions.

✨ UI/UX Enhancements

Add toast or modal confirmation on successful login/signup.

Show password strength meter.

Add resend verification option with cooldown timer.

Handle loading/spinner states during network requests.

📦 Deployment Readiness

Setup CI/CD pipeline for lint, test, and build.

Dockerize the app for clean and scalable deployment.

Configure reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) and SSL.

Use environment-based logging (debug vs production).
